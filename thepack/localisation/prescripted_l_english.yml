 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans1:0 "United Nations of Earth"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans1_desc:0 "The myriad Human nations that constitute their interstellar government are disparate, yet united in purpose. These bipedal mammalians have developed a society that encourages and even thrives on individual freedoms and cultural differences - as a result, Humans tend to integrate well with alien populations.\n\nDespite this, they have strong martial traditions (produced by millennia of intermittent warfare on their homeworld) and their sometimes aggressive and unpredictable nature should not be underestimated."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans2:0 "Commonwealth of Man"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans2_desc:0 "The UN-sponsored Ulysses Initiative oversaw the construction of six great ark ships in low Earth orbit at the end of the 21st century. The ships were fitted with powerful but unstable wormhole generators and sent towards distant stars carrying a quarter million colonists each. None were heard from again, and research into subspace wormholes was soon abandoned.\n\nYet unbeknownst to Earth, one of the ark ships made it to a lush alien moon and established a flourishing colony. The pioneers who tamed this world were determined to realize humanity's manifest destiny - dominion over the galaxy at any cost."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_tzynn:0 "Tzynn Empire"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_tzynn_desc:0 "The Tzynn evolved from carnivorous, pack-hunting lizards that prowled the dunes of Tzynnia. They eventually developed a highly structured, hierarchical society that emphasized order and martial prowess above all else.\n\nBy the time the Tzynn entered the industrial age, a series of devastating global wars launched by a particularly ruthless warlord had already seen the establishment of a single, world-spanning nation. From these humble beginnings, the illustrious and ever-lasting Tzynn Empire was born."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_yondar:0 "Kingdom of Yondarim"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_yondar_desc:0 "The proud Yondar are an old race, using their wings to soar high above the steaming jungles of Yondarim for more than 200,000 years before they developed rudimentary technology and formed their first few scattered civilizations.\n\nOnce this development started, things progressed more rapidly and the Sky Clans grudgingly abandoned many of their most primitive traditions. The Yondar are highly spiritual and place great importance on religion, venerating their high kings as living gods."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_ixidar:0 "Ix'Idar Star Collective"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_ixidar_desc:0 "The first Ix'Idar broods developed in the subterranean cave networks deep beneath the surface of Ix'Athrak. By the time an Ix'Idar scout burrowed through to the surface and glimpsed sunlight for the first time, the insectoid race had already established a thriving Iron Age civilization.\n\nWith the resources they found on the surface, the Ix'Idar developed rapidly. Just a few centuries later their first space probes left orbit to survey the other worlds within the Ix'Im system."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_chinorr:0 "Chinorr Stellar Union"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_chinorr_desc:0 "The Chinorr began their evolutionary journey as dexterous cephalopod analogues. They used their many tentacles to swing between trees in the lush jungles of Chicora, ambushing prey on the ground and injecting them with a potent nerve toxin.\n\nBy the time the Chinorr split the atom, the resources of Chicora had been ruthlessly exploited and the planet's jungles had long since disappeared. This was considered a necessary sacrifice in the relentless pursuit of knowledge and heavy industry that the unsentimental Chinorr were now engaged in."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_jehetma:0 "Jehetma Dominion"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_jehetma_desc:0 "An "individual" among the Jehetma is actually a large colony of fungi that has developed sentience. Some of these colonies, generally those that have lived for thousands of years, stretch across several miles and rarely leave the surface of Jehet Prime, their homeworld (few ships are large enough to transport them).\n\nYounger colonies are not only smaller, but also tend to be more dynamic and mobile - they often spearhead the exploration and research efforts of the Jehetma, as well as any defensive measures that are regrettably undertaken when the Dominion is beset by aggressors."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_scyldari:0 "Scyldari Confederacy"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_scyldari_desc:0 "The Scyldari are aquatic mammalians originating from the archipelagos and deep oceans of Scyldaria. Although their early civilizations were mostly confined to the sea, they soon expanded onto what little landmass the planet had to offer.\n\nTheir society adapted accordingly, building an advanced industry that exploited the riches of the ocean floor without harming Scyldaria's delicate ecosystem. Scyldari philosophy is one of balance and moderation in all things, a lesson learned from having to nurse their limited resources when they were confined to the bottom of the sea."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_kel_azaan:0 "Kel-Azaan Interplanetary Alliance"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_kel_azaan_desc:0 "These furry, cold-blooded mammalians have developed a complex honor code and martial culture. The Kel-Azaan were once solitary herbivores that journeyed from cave to cave across the icy wastes of Azak to feed off roots and lichen. To defend against predators, bands of Kel-Azaan gathered annually to hunt the hunters and keep the cave routes safe. They eventually abandoned this solitary lifestyle in favor of cities and subterranean agriculture, but their martial traditions were never forgotten."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_paridni:0 "Paridni Mercantile Republic"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_paridni_desc:0 "Crustacean analogues, the Paridni are a species of enterprising traders. They are very accepting of other alien cultures, as long as those cultures aren't adverse to the cardinal tenet around which Paridni society revolves - commerce. The Shadow Council, a body of influential merchants, is charged with safeguarding trade within the Republic and opening up new markets (by force if necessary)."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_advocacy:0 "Advocacy"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_advocacy_desc:0 "Evolved on a cold, mountainous planet of frequent tectonic activity and few abundant food sources, the Ah'Ren developed a fierce resolution for self-reliance and independence that prevented any government beyond loose tribes for the majority of their history. Eventually, a string of warrior-philosophers provided strong justifications for a guiding, unifying authority which many members of the tribes responded well to. Although this Advocacy has at best nominal control over the members of the species, most modern Ah'Ren regard it highly enough to provide a regular tithe to the organization tasked with accomplishing things individual members of the species cannot achieve on their own."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_ascendancy:0 "Ascendancy"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_ascendancy_desc:0 "Obsessed with power, a few Ah'Ren clans abandoned the communal Advocacy early to found their own empire. The Ascendancy is based "
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_maynapii:0 "Maynapii"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_maynapii_desc:0 "From the near barren world of Mayna come the Maynapii, a mammalian race just entering the search for space friends. Maynapii culture is heavily influenced by the inhospitality of its homeworld. An extremely pacifistic society arose from the safeguarding of sparse resources, such that the act of destroying property is considered as heinous a crime as murder. The societal focus around the protection and development of resources not only had the effect of flattening social strata, but in the promotion of men and women who could best protect those resources to positions of power. Today a wide spanning bureaucracy dedicated to quantifying and analyzing every aspect of the Republic exists, so much so that its power dwarfs even the legislature. Although the Maynapii are only a Republic in name only, their leader the Caesar holds little in the way of direct power. Instead, power is invested in various Ministries devoted to science, administration, and military affairs. The civilian leader, the Chief Minister, is confirmed by a vote in the Republic’s Senate, though in modern times their selection is the culmination of an intense series of tests supervised and administered by the Ministry of Human Resources. It is recorded that in pre-warp history there are a few examples of non bureaucratic candidates achieving the Chief Ministry, but even if the contest is open to any citizen of the Republic there have not been any non-bureaucrats elected in over 300 years. From first blush Maynapii society can look feudal to an outside observer as the power wielded by bureaucrats over their districts can appear akin to a Lord and his fief. Indeed many of the titles of these administrators are often translated into titles of nobility, a Viscount, a Marquess, a Duke, even though the concept of hereditary leadership is completely foreign on Mayna.  As the Mayna reach out into the stars, societal tensions have become more and more pronounced as the desperate fight to eke out the resources of life turns to a period of unnatural abundance. For a civilization to whom ostentatious displays of opulence would be considered criminal, there is a growing division between the new generations and the elder Mayanpii who can still remember the hardships of the past. These divisions are accentuated even more by their unusually long lifespan, an effect of their hearty constitution. Many younger Maynapii chafe at the growing trend of their elders to stick to positions of power in the Ministries instead of the previous traditions of stepping aside for those coming up next. In all, the Maynapii can be expected to be extremely aggressive in their pursuit of new minerals and sources of energy, and almost as equally pacifistic in their dealings with new species. But who’s to say what the future has in store?"
