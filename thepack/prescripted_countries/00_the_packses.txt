It is the fervently held belief of the Maladomini that their place in Avernus is to lead themselves--and others--in the search for inward perfection in the search for eternity. By conquering the crude needs and impulses of the body, the mind and spirit will be freed. Only then can the spirit truly command the body to transcendence and, thus, eternal life."
